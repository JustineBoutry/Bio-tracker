# 🧬 Biological Experiment & Longitudinal Data Management Platform
## Overview
This application is designed to manage biological experiments, track individuals longitudinally, and integrate multiple types of experimental measurements into structured, reusable datasets.
It enables automatic data consolidation to generate clean, analysis‑ready datasets, easily transferable to statistical environments such as R.
The project was developed using Base44 – Intuitive Coding, with a strong focus on open science, data reproducibility, and accessibility.
